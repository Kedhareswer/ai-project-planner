# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Summarizer interface is complex, cluttered, and not user-friendly. Users are experiencing issues with content not being processed correctly, and the interface lacks clear organization. This document outlines requirements to redesign the Summarizer with a clean three-tab interface that separates input, processing, and analytics for better user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean three-tab interface in the Summarizer so that I can easily navigate between input, results, and analytics without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Summarizer page THEN I SHALL see three distinct tabs: "Input", "Summary", and "Analytics"
2. WHEN I click on any tab THEN the interface SHALL switch to that tab's content smoothly
3. WHEN I'm on the Input tab THEN I SHALL see all input methods and settings clearly organized
4. IF I haven't generated a summary yet THEN the Summary and Analytics tabs SHALL be disabled or show empty states

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a comprehensive Input tab where I can upload files, provide URLs, paste text, and configure settings so that all input methods are organized in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm on the Input tab THEN I SHALL see four distinct input sections: File Upload, URL Input, Text Input, and Smart Web Search
2. WHEN I upload a file THEN the system SHALL show upload progress and file validation feedback
3. WHEN I provide a URL THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format and show preview of extracted content
4. WHEN I paste text THEN the system SHALL show character count and processing preview
5. WHEN I use Smart Web Search THEN the system SHALL provide search suggestions and content preview
6. WHEN I access Advanced Settings THEN I SHALL see AI model selection, summary length, focus areas, and output format options
7. IF I have content in multiple input methods THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which will be used for processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dedicated Summary tab that shows my summarization results with key statistics so that I can focus on the generated content without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN summarization completes THEN the Summary tab SHALL automatically become active and show the results
2. WHEN I'm on the Summary tab THEN I SHALL see the generated summary prominently displayed
3. WHEN viewing the summary THEN I SHALL see key statistics: reading time, compression ratio, word count, and confidence score
4. WHEN the summary is ready THEN I SHALL have options to copy, download, share, and regenerate the summary
5. IF summarization fails THEN the Summary tab SHALL show clear error messages with suggested actions
6. WHEN I regenerate a summary THEN the tab SHALL show loading states and update with new results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a comprehensive Analytics tab that shows detailed statistics and history of all my summarized content so that I can track my usage and analyze patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Analytics tab THEN I SHALL see detailed statistics about the current summary
2. WHEN viewing analytics THEN I SHALL see sentiment analysis, key topics, difficulty level, and content structure analysis
3. WHEN I check my history THEN I SHALL see all previously summarized files with dates, titles, and quick access options
4. WHEN I view usage statistics THEN I SHALL see total summaries created, average compression ratios, and most used input methods
5. WHEN I click on a historical summary THEN I SHALL be able to view, re-download, or delete it
6. IF I have no summary history THEN the Analytics tab SHALL show helpful onboarding content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be responsive and accessible so that I can use the Summarizer effectively on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Summarizer on mobile THEN the tabs SHALL be optimized for touch interaction
2. WHEN I use the interface on tablet THEN all content SHALL be properly sized and accessible
3. WHEN I navigate with keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL be properly focusable
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN all content SHALL be properly labeled and announced
5. IF the screen size is small THEN the interface SHALL adapt gracefully without losing functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback and progress indicators throughout the summarization process so that I understand what's happening at each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start summarization THEN I SHALL see a progress indicator showing the current processing step
2. WHEN processing is in progress THEN I SHALL see estimated time remaining and current operation
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN I SHALL see clear error messages with specific guidance on how to resolve the issue
4. WHEN switching between tabs THEN I SHALL see visual indicators of which tabs have content or are processing
5. IF processing takes longer than expected THEN I SHALL see updated progress information and options to cancel

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the ability to save and manage my summarization settings so that I don't have to reconfigure them each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure settings in the Input tab THEN the system SHALL remember my preferences for future sessions
2. WHEN I have preferred AI models or settings THEN the system SHALL use them as defaults
3. WHEN I want to reset settings THEN I SHALL have a clear option to restore defaults
4. WHEN I save a custom configuration THEN I SHALL be able to name it and reuse it later
5. IF I'm a returning user THEN my previous settings SHALL be automatically loaded

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless integration between the three tabs so that my workflow feels natural and connected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete input configuration THEN the system SHALL automatically enable the Summary tab for processing
2. WHEN summarization completes THEN the Analytics tab SHALL be populated with relevant data
3. WHEN I make changes in the Input tab THEN the system SHALL clear previous results and update tab states accordingly
4. WHEN I navigate between tabs THEN my progress and data SHALL be preserved
5. IF I start a new summarization THEN the system SHALL appropriately reset tab states while preserving settings
