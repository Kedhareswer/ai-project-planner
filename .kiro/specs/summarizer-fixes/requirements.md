# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Summarizer feature in Bolt Research Hub has several critical issues that prevent it from working correctly. This document outlines the requirements to fix these issues and improve the overall functionality and reliability of the document summarization system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Summarizer to correctly process AI API responses so that I can successfully generate summaries without encountering API response parsing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generate API returns a response THEN the Summarizer SHALL correctly parse the response field instead of looking for a non-existent content field
2. WHEN the AI API response contains the generated text THEN the Summarizer SHALL extract and display the summary content properly
3. IF the AI API response format changes THEN the Summarizer SHALL handle both old and new response formats gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload PDF files and have them properly processed so that I can summarize PDF documents effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a PDF file THEN the system SHALL extract meaningful text content from the PDF
2. WHEN the PDF extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide a helpful error message with alternative solutions
3. WHEN the PDF is processed successfully THEN the extracted text SHALL be clean and readable for summarization
4. IF the PDF contains complex formatting THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without breaking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want robust error handling throughout the Summarizer so that I receive clear feedback when something goes wrong and know how to resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message with actionable guidance
2. WHEN file processing fails THEN the system SHALL indicate the specific issue and suggest alternatives
3. WHEN AI generation fails THEN the system SHALL attempt fallback providers if available
4. IF all providers fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on how to resolve API key issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Summarizer to handle large documents efficiently so that I can summarize lengthy content without encountering token limits or timeouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide content that exceeds token limits THEN the system SHALL automatically chunk the content appropriately
2. WHEN chunking is used THEN the system SHALL maintain context and coherence across chunks
3. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback to the user
4. IF content is too large even after chunking THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative approaches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the file upload functionality to work reliably with all supported file types so that I can summarize various document formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a supported file type THEN the system SHALL process it correctly using the appropriate extraction method
2. WHEN file processing libraries are missing THEN the system SHALL provide fallback processing or clear error messages
3. WHEN a file is corrupted or unreadable THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
4. IF a file type is unsupported THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which formats are supported

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the URL content extraction to work reliably so that I can summarize web articles and online content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a valid URL THEN the system SHALL extract clean, readable content from the webpage
2. WHEN a URL is inaccessible or blocked THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages with alternatives
3. WHEN content extraction fails THEN the system SHALL suggest manual copy-paste as an alternative
4. IF the webpage has dynamic content THEN the system SHALL handle it appropriately or inform the user of limitations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Summarizer interface to provide clear feedback about the summarization process so that I understand what's happening and can troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN summarization is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and progress indicators
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display the error prominently with actionable next steps
3. WHEN summarization completes THEN the system SHALL show comprehensive results with statistics
4. IF the summary quality is poor THEN the system SHALL provide options to retry with different settings
